'''
Below, we are adding a string and an integer. 
To do this addition, we must convert the string to an integer.
This only works because the string's value is "3".
'''
print(int(s) + i_1) # 15

'''
The example below is another way to add a string and an integer.
This time, we converted the integer to a string.
'''
print(s + str(i_1)) # 312

'''
Convert a string to an int
'''
print(int(s)) # 3

'''
When we add an integer and a float, the integer gets promted to a float.
That's why the result is a float.
'''
print(i_1 + f) # 28.12

'''
When we add an integer and a boolean, the boolean gets assigned an integer value.
True = 1 and False = 0
'''
print(i_2 + b_1) # 5

'''
When we add a float and a boolean, the boolean still gets assigned the same integer value.
Then, the integer gets promoted to a float, and the result is a float.
'''
print(pi + b_2) # 3.1415926535

'''
The example below is using regular division.
This will be the exact result of the division.
'''
print(9/2) # 4.5

'''
This example is using floor division.
The exact result is rounded down to the nearest whole number.
'''
print(9//2) # 4

"""
Any non-zero integer in Python is considered "truthy" â€“ meaning when evaluated in a Boolean context (like the condition of an if statement or when passed to bool()), it behaves like True.
However, the Boolean value True is actually represented internally as the integer 1. This is why the comparison bool_shoot == True (which is 2 == 1) evaluates to False.
